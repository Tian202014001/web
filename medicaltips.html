                            Never let your hectic schedule or fatigue get in the way of properly washing your hands,
                            cleaning tools and equipment, or collaborating with the rest of the team to guarantee a
                            sanitized and safe atmosphere. There are specialized companies which are dedicated

                            specific policies to assist in efficient infection control.Nurses are
                            among the first line of defense against illness; thus, they must be meticulous about
                            washing
                            their hands and using hand sanitizers (if soap and water are not available) on a regular
                            basis. Proper handwashing is one of the most effective methods to keep yourself, your
                            family, and others safe. Nurses should follow a six-step procedure: 1) wet the hands 2)
                            lather with soap on the backs of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails 3)
                            rub
                            the hands for at least twenty seconds 4) rinse well with running water 5) dry hands on a
                            clean towel 6) use dry paper towel to switch off the tap and touch the handle of the
                            door.
                            Hand cleanliness is the most effective way to avoid catching and spreading infectious
                            germs.
                            Most centers advise gloves to be used only when needed (when in contact with bodily
                            fluids)
                            and that they are removed as soon as possible once the task is completed. <br>

                            <br>
                            It is equally important for nurses to be vigilant at home. They must remain at home when
                            ill to keep infections out of the healthcare environment. It is a good idea for nurses
                            to have more than one pair of work shoes on rotation and to leave these in the car when
                            arriving home. If they need to be washed, make sure to effectively clean your hands
                            before and after touching them. Also, for non-work-related activities, you should have a
                            separate pair of shoes. Before interacting with your family, take off your work clothes
                            and have a shower. Wash and sanitize those clothes as soon as possible.

                            Infection control goes both ways and nurses need to be diligent with the basics and
                            practice safety precautions for themselves and their patients. <br>

                                    It is equally important for nurses to be vigilant at home. They must remain at home
                                    when
                                    ill to keep infections out of the healthcare environment. It is a good idea for
                                    nurses
                                    to have more than one pair of work shoes on rotation and to leave these in the car
                                    when
                                    arriving home. If they need to be washed, make sure to effectively clean your hands
                                    before and after touching them. Also, for non-work-related activities, you should
                                    have a
                                    separate pair of shoes. Before interacting with your family, take off your work
                                    clothes
                                    and have a shower. Wash and sanitize those clothes as soon as possible.

                                    Infection control goes both ways and nurses need to be diligent with the basics and
                                    practice safety precautions for themselves and their patients. <br>

                                        It is equally important for nurses to be vigilant at home. They must remain at

                                        nurses
                                        to have more than one pair of work shoes on rotation and to leave these in the

                                        when
                                        arriving home. If they need to be washed, make sure to effectively clean your
                                        hands
                                        before and after touching them. Also, for non-work-related activities, you
                                        should
                                        have a
                                        separate pair of shoes. Before interacting with your family, take off your work
                                        clothes
                                        and have a shower. Wash and sanitize those clothes as soon as possible.

                                        Infection control goes both ways and nurses need to be diligent with the basics
                                        and
                                        practice safety precautions for themselves and their patients. <br>

                                            It is equally important for nurses to be vigilant at home. They must remain
                                            at
                                            home when

                                            nurses
                                            to have more than one pair of work shoes on rotation and to leave these in
                                            the
                                            car when
                                            arriving home. If they need to be washed, make sure to effectively clean
                                            your
                                            hands
                                            before and after touching them. Also, for non-work-related activities, you
                                            should have a
                                            separate pair of shoes. Before interacting with your family, take off your
                                            work
                                            clothes
                                            and have a shower. Wash and sanitize those clothes as soon as possible.

                                            Infection control goes both ways and nurses need to be diligent with the
                                            basics
                                            and
                                            practice safety precautions for themselves and their patients. <br>

                                            It is equally important for nurses to be vigilant at home. They must remain
                                            at
                                            home when

                                            nurses
                                            to have more than one pair of work shoes on rotation and to leave these in
                                            the
                                            car when
                                            arriving home. If they need to be washed, make sure to effectively clean
                                            your
                                            hands
                                            before and after touching them. Also, for non-work-related activities, you
                                            should have a
                                            separate pair of shoes. Before interacting with your family, take off your
                                            work
                                            clothes
                                            and have a shower. Wash and sanitize those clothes as soon as possible.

                                            Infection control goes both ways and nurses need to be diligent with the
                                            basics
                                            and
                                            practice safety precautions for themselves and their patients. <br>

                                            It is equally important for nurses to be vigilant at home. They must remain
                                            at
                                            home when

                                            nurses
                                            to have more than one pair of work shoes on rotation and to leave these in

                                            hands
                                            before and after touching them. Also, for non-work-related activities, you
                                            should have a
                                            separate pair of shoes. Before interacting with your family, take off your

                                            clothes
                                            and have a shower. Wash and sanitize those clothes as soon as possible.

                                            Infection control goes both ways and nurses need to be diligent with the
                                            basics
                                            and
                                            practice safety precautions for themselves and their patients. <br>

                                            It is equally important for nurses to be vigilant at home. They must remain
                                            at
                                            home when

                                            for
                                            nurses
                                            to have more than one pair of work shoes on rotation and to leave these in

                                            car when
                                            arriving home. If they need to be washed, make sure to effectively clean
                                            your
                                            hands
                                            before and after touching them. Also, for non-work-related activities, you
                                            should have a
                                            separate pair of shoes. Before interacting with your family, take off your
                                            work
                                            clothes
                                            and have a shower. Wash and sanitize those clothes as soon as possible.

                                            Infection control goes both ways and nurses need to be diligent with the
                                            basics
                                            and
                                            practice safety precautions for themselves and their patients. <br>

                                            It is equally important for nurses to be vigilant at home. They must remain
                                            at
                                            home when

                                            for
                                            nurses
                                            to have more than one pair of work shoes on rotation and to leave these in
                                            the
                                            car when
                                            arriving home. If they need to be washed, make sure to effectively clean
                                            your
                                            hands
                                            before and after touching them. Also, for non-work-related activities, you
                                            should have a
                                            separate pair of shoes. Before interacting with your family, take off your
                                            work
                                            clothes
                                            and have a shower. Wash and sanitize those clothes as soon as possible.

                                            Infection control goes both ways and nurses need to be diligent with the
                                            basics
                                            and
                                            practice safety precautions for themselves and their patients. <br>

                                            Most centers advise gloves to be used only when needed (when in contact with

                                            It is equally important for nurses to be vigilant at home. They must remain
                                            at
                                            home when
                                            ill to keep infections out of the healthcare environment. It is a good idea
                                            for
                                            nurses
                                            to have more than one pair of work shoes on rotation and to leave these in
                                            the
                                            car when
                                            arriving home. If they need to be washed, make sure to effectively clean
                                            your
                                            hands
                                            before and after touching them. Also, for non-work-related activities, you
                                            should have a
                                            separate pair of shoes. Before interacting with your family, take off your
                                            work
                                            clothes
                                            and have a shower. Wash and sanitize those clothes as soon as possible.

                                            Infection control goes both ways and nurses need to be diligent with the
                                            basics
                                            and
                                            practice safety precautions for themselves and their patients. <br>
